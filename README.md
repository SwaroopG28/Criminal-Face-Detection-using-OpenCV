# Criminal Face Detection using OpenCV

This project implements a **Criminal Face Detection System** using **OpenCV** and **face_recognition** libraries. The system captures face images, encodes facial features, and performs real-time face recognition to identify known individuals. It can be utilized in security and surveillance systems.



The project consists of three main Python scripts:

1. **face_record.py**: Script to capture and save face images.
2. **encode_faces.py**: Script to encode the saved face images.
3. **face_recognition.py**: Script for real-time face recognition.
